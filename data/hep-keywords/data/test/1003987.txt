Scalar black branes with non-AdS asymptotics
Black brane solutions with scalar hair and with non-AdS asymptotics have several features that make them very interesting for holographic applications: (1) They allow to circumvent usual no-hair theorems; (2) They may have a non singular extremal limit in the form of a scalar soliton that interpolates between AdS and non-AdS vacua; (3) They allow for phase transitions between the Schwarzschild-AdS (SADS) and scalar dressed black branes; (4) They give an holographic realization of hyperscaling violation in critical systems. In this note I illustrate these features using an exact integrable Einstein-scalar gravity model.
