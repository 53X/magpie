High density cluster jet target for storage ring experiments
The design and performance of a newly developed cluster jet target installation for hadron physics experiments are presented which, for the first time, is able to generate a hydrogen cluster jet beam with a target thickness of above $10^{15}\,\mathrm{atoms/cm}^2$ at a distance of two metres behind the cluster jet nozzle. The properties of the cluster beam and of individual clusters themselves are studied at this installation. Special emphasis is placed on measurements of the target beam density as a function of the relevant parameters as well as on the cluster beam profiles. By means of a time-of-flight setup, measurements of the velocity of single clusters and velocity distributions were possible. The complete installation, which meets the requirements of future internal fixed target experiments at storage rings, and the results of the systematic studies on hydrogen cluster jets are presented and discussed.
