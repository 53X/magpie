Supersymmetric AdS$_{5}$ solutions of massive IIA supergravity
Motivated by a recently found class of AdS$_{7}$ solutions, we classify AdS$_{5}$ solutions in massive IIA, finding infinitely many new analytical examples. We reduce the general problem to a set of PDEs, determining the local internal metric, which is a fibration over a surface. Under a certain simplifying assumption, we are then able to analytically solve the PDEs and give a complete list of all solutions. Among these, one class is new and regular. These spaces can be related to the AdS$_{7}$ solutions via a simple universal map for the metric, dilaton and fluxes. The natural interpretation of this map is that the dual CFT$_{6}$ and CFT$_{4}$ are related by twisted compactification on a Riemann surface Σ$_{g}$ . The ratio of their free energy coefficients is proportional to the Euler characteristic of Σ$_{g}$ . As a byproduct, we also find the analytic expression for the AdS$_{7}$ solutions, which were previously known only numerically. We determine the free energy for simple examples: it is a simple cubic function of the flux integers.
