A new measurement of the neutron detection efficiency for the NaI Crystal Ball detector
We report on a measurement of the neutron detection efficiency in NaI crystals in the Crystal Ball detector obtained from a study of single Ï€(0) photoproduction on deuterium using the tagged photon beam at the Mainz Microtron. The results were obtained up to a neutron energy of 400 MeV . They are compared to previous measurements made more than 15 years ago at the pion beam at the BNL AGS.
