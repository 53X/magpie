Phenomenological tests of supersymmetric A(4) family symmetry model of neutrino mass
Recently Babu, Ma and Valle proposed a model of quark and lepton mixing based on $A_4$ symmetry. Within this model the lepton and slepton mixings are intimately related. We perform a numerical study in order to derive the slepton masses and mixings in agreement with present data from neutrino physics. We show that, starting from three-fold degeneracy of the neutrino masses at a high energy scale, a viable low energy neutrino mass matrix can indeed be obtained in agreement with constraints on lepton flavour violating $\mu$ and $\tau$ decays. The resulting slepton spectrum must necessarily include at least one mass below 200 GeV which can be produced at the LHC. The predictions for the absolute Majorana neutrino mass scale $m_0 \geq 0.3$ eV ensure that the model will be tested by future cosmological tests and $\beta\beta_{0\nu}$ searches. Rates for lepton flavour violating processes $\ell_j \to \ell_i + \gamma$ in the range of sensitivity of current experiments are typical in the model, with BR$(\mu \to e \gamma) \gsim 10^{-15}$ and the lower bound BR$(\tau \to \mu \gamma) > 10^{-9}$. To first approximation, the model leads to maximal leptonic CP violation in neutrino oscillations.
